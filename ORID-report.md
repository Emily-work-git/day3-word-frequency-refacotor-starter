### ORID Report - Emily ###


#### Objective: What Did We Learn Today?
Today, we explored about code smell and refactoring. We talked about the common signs that indicate when code needs a makeover and what refactoring really means. We also covered different techniques and best practices for refactoring to make our code cleaner. Plus, we explored concept maps, which is a tool to organize our knowledge by visualizing the relationships between concepts. Lastly, we got the hang of some handy IntelliJ hotkeys that make refactoring a lot quicker.

#### Reflective: My Feelings
I think refactoring is important for making our code better and easier to work with, and using hotkeys really help speed things up and save a ton of effort. But to be honest, i think refactoring is a tedious and frustrating task, especially when dealing with poorly written code. On the bright side, using concept maps has helped me connect the dots in my learning, which makes everything feel a bit more manageable.

#### Interpretive: Why?
These feelings come from the mixed bag that is refactoring. On one hand, it feels great to improve the code and work faster with hotkeys. On the other hand, dealing with poorly written code can be frustrating and make the whole process feel heavy. These feelings remind me of how crucial tasking and maintaining good coding practice is. When we take time to properly structure our tasks, splitting them into meaningful pieces and make sure we follow the single-responsibility principle, we can avoid code smell from the start. Yet it is still important for us to refactor on time, to make sure our code quality is up to standard, and easy to maintain.

#### Direction: Action Points - What Changes Will I Make?
Looking ahead, I want to use concept maps more often to keep my learning organized and connected. I also plan to practice refactoring regularly, even when it feels tedious, to get better at it. Plus, Iâ€™ll try to learn more IntelliJ hotkeys to make my workflow smoother. By making these changes, I hope to improve my coding skills and make refactoring feel less overwhelming and more efficient.
